<h2>Matthew</h2>
Hi, I'm Matthew! I am a COEN major who just absolutely loves backend development. I was inspired by this project because
of the work I do at my church; it is unfortunate that it can be so difficult for some people to live where they want to</div>

<h2>Edmund</h2>
Hello! My name is Edmund Allen. Throughout the course of this project I focused primarily on backend developoment and coordination
    of my teammates. In my free time, I love spending time with my family and participating the SCU's orchestra, where I am
    the principle violist.

<h2>Ethan</h2>
I'm Ethan, nice to meet you too! It has been a long time since I worked on frontend development for anything, so this project
was extremely challenging. Outside of coding and school, I am an avid chess player and violinist, as well as a film buff.
I was drawn to Naturalize Me because it reminded me of the stories my parents told me about them immigrating to the states
and the difficulties they had navigating the foreign legal system. </div>

<h2>Donal</h2>
Hello! Perhaps the most fun thing I can share about myself is this: I was born and raised in Ireland, and now, I speak with
    a completely standard pacific western accent with the sole exception of when I say the word "Ireland."
